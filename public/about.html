<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>""Hi there! I'm Belal Elsirty, hailing from the vibrant city of New Cairo, Egypt. 
  Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at AASTMT, diving deep into the realm of Computer Science. 
  Beyond academics, I'm also known for my prowess in swimming; it's not just a hobby, 
  it's a passion! Alongside hitting the pool, I find solace in fitness activities, 
  constantly pushing my limits to stay in top shape. And when I'm not submerged in water or breaking a sweat, 
  you can find me unleashing my creative side through drawing, where every stroke tells a story. Additionally, 
  I find joy in playing the piano, losing myself in the melodies that resonate with my soul. Life's a canvas, 
  and I'm here to make it colorful, one stroke, one stroke, one key at a time!"
